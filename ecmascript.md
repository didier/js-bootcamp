# II â€” ECMAScript

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript, or JS for short, is a "Just-In-Time" (JIT)-compiled programming language. It's most often associated with being the 'functionality' of the web, but it runs on a lot of other platforms as well. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is a great example of a JavaScript runtime outside of the browser.

## Who maintains it?

Ecma International is the foundation behind the language. They wrote a standardized document for JavaScript, the ECMA Specification. They have been releasing annual releases of the JavaScript language in the form of ECMAScript (ES). "ECMAScript is the standard upon which JavaScript is based".

Previously, they named the ES versions regular numbers, such as ES5 and ES6. But since 2015, they've decided to switch to appending the current year to the name, instead of a number. Yearly releases are now denoted as ES2015, ES2016, etc.

The people actually working on evolving JavaScript as a language form a committee called TC39. TC39 consists of people from some of the world's largest companies, such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla, Facebook and more.
